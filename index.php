                    <p>Learning with BernHardt:
                        Learning with BernHardt made me realise true meaning of learning.
                        Learning gets to the heart of what it means to be human. 
                        It is through learning that we continuously recreate ourselves and become 
                        able to do things we were never able to do before.
                        Learning enables us to perceive the world afresh and our relationship to it. 
                        As we learn so we further extend our capacity to create, to be part of the generative process of life itself.
                        I was able to enjoy the process of learning and were able to sharpen my communication skills and
                        were able to make many awesome friends in the process who helped me in my learning journey.

                    <p>True Meaning of learning........
                        True Meaning of learning for life since its beginning BernHardt College has been in the choice of many
                        brilliant students and mine too. It was my first choice during the time of my admission and I feel proud to share
                        with others. It has bridged my school life to my adulthood in such a way that none others would possibly have done.
                        The well experienced and professional teaching faculty have the full credit for what I stand at present.
                        The well-rounded education in this college helped me to stand out as a responsible citizen in the society.
