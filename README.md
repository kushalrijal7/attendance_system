# attendance_system

First Project for Web Technology.
In this project we are able to handle the attendance of 
the user but the credentiality will be only available to the admin pannel person 
so that common user won't be able to reconfigure the system.
In this system admin is able to see the absent or present information
of the student according to the real date.
